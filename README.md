####What I Find Interesting:

##The Power

Apple's new M1 Max SOC is the most powerful notebook chip available on the market as
of today. The chip functions on the ARM arhicthecure, marking Apple's departure from
the Intel x86 one. This transition allows Apple to properly tap into the power of the
TSMC 5 nm SOCs and deliver amazing performance per watt. The new M1 Max features a 10
core CPU with 8 performance cores and 2 efficiency cores. Since the chip is an APU
it also features a powerful GPU with an impressive 32 GPU cores. This all adds up to 
57 billion transistors and overall 10 teraflops of overall power. The chip also houses
the unified memoy, which allows all the components to share the same memory unit. Since
the CPU and GPU share memory, they do not need to spend time and power copying data to
access things. These components work together with the neural engine for machine learning
tasks, the secure enclave for encryption, and the video encoders for content creation to 
make this laptop one of the most versatile and cohesive computers ever produced.

##The Efficiency
The reason why I think that this chip is the most relevant is due to its amazing power-per-
watt performance. Sure, there are many desktop level processors that can probably beat out
this cheap (but actually, they are few and far between), but the thing that truly sets this
machine apart is its power usage. It is able to compete with many pro-level laptops while
using under 100 watts of power. This means that when you are using this laptop as - say -
a student in school, you can get 20 hours of comfortable battery life. When you want to
ramp up and run simulations or do something intensive, it is able to meet up with that
demand.
